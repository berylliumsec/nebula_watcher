## Acknowledgement

First i would like to thank the All-Mighty God who is the source of all knowledge, without Him, this would not be possible.


## Why?

Nebula Watcher offers a method for ethical hackers to monitor the IP addresses and ports they've engaged with during a penetration test. It serves as a visual tool to ensure comprehensive coverage of all intended IP addresses and ports under examination.

## Features

- Parses NMAP scan results (in plain text format) from a specified directory and returns only IP addresses with open ports.
- Monitors network connections and matches them against the parsed NMAP scan results.
- Generates a visual diagram depicting the activity, with different colors indicating the type of connection.
- Periodically updates the diagram, maintaining a history of the ethical hacking activity.

## Dependencies
- [graphviz] (https://graphviz.org/)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [diagrams](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams)
- [psutil](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Installation

The easiest way to get started is to use the docker image. Please note that the ZAP model is NOT supported in the docker image. If you would like to use ZAP please install the package using `pip`.


**Docker**:

Pulling the image:

``` bash
docker pull berylliumsec/nebula-watcher:latest
```
Running the image docker image :

```bash
docker run -v directory_containing_results/nmap_plain_text:/app/results -v where/you/want/the/diagrams:/app/output  berylliumsec/nebula-watcher:latest
```


**PIP**:

```
pip install nebula-watcher
```

To run nebula simply enter:

```bash 
nebula-watcher
``` 
## Options:

--results_dir : Specify the directory containing NMAP scan results. (Default: ./results)
--diagram_name : Specify the name for the generated diagram. (Default: hacking_activity)
--clear_state : Use this flag if you want to start the script without using the previous state. This can be helpful for debugging purposes.

A state file named `state.json` is written to the current working directory to preserve states even when you close the monitoring tool.
## How It Works

- The script first parses the NMAP scan results to identify open ports on different IP addresses.
- It then monitors live network connections on the machine it's running on.
- When a network connection matches an IP and port from the NMAP results, the color of the arrow goes from red to blue on the diagram.
- The diagram is periodically updated to reflect the current state of the network connections.
